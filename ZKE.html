<td> <h3><font color=#D9C586>My name is Zhumagali Kanat Yerkinovich and I was born on January 10, 2003 in the city of Shymkent. I am the third son in the family, there are six of us in total: parents and four sons, including me.  Father Makhashov Yerkin Zhumagalievich was born in 1969, and mother Omarova Raikhan Daribayevna was born in 1968. In general, the first thing I remember from my life is the view from afar of my kindergarten, which I went to before the beginning of school life.  However, I remember for sure that I missed the last year of kindergarten, due to my mother's decree and a simple desire not to go to kindergarten. It seemed interesting to me to stay at home and watch with my mother and brothers a good Korean TV series about Jumong, the founder of the ancient state of Goguryeo.  Yes, in addition to the series, there were many children on my street with whom I could play, as well as brothers with whom I was never bored
The school period of my life began when I was 6 years old and lasted until I was 17. What can I say about this period? Well, let's start with the fact that by the 1st grade I had no friends as such, except for my brothers, respectively. And the main initiator of the fact that by the age of 6 I went to school, I will take this credit on myself (I hope so), was myself, telling my father in every possible way that I would like to go to school like my older brothers. According to my teachers and in general all the people who were not my family, I was the quietest person in the classroom, and everywhere. By the 5th grade, I had a man whom I would call a friend, Zafar, my classmate, and a little later another one, Murat, appeared. Probably, the main reason that we became friends was that the way back home was common for the three of us, well, actually mobile games, which were the main object for communication. Just don't think that I talked only with friends, I spent a good time with classmates during my studies, I really enjoyed watching their actions. The best of my friends, with whom I communicate to this day, I met in 8th and 9th grade, after transferring to the lyceum physical mat class, Alexey and Igor. They literally became the meaning of going to school even on days when there was absolutely no desire to attend school. In the last years of school, I realized how much I generally like to study here, in the company of my classmates and teachers. I especially liked studying with Evgeny Nikolaevich Konnikov, a physics teacher who just gave us excellent knowledge. It was a complete synonym for the word justice. It is a pity that the last year of study fell into quarantine and a full farewell to the school with all its ceremonies did not work out. 
After that, the university began. There is nothing deep in choosing this particular university, I just heard about this university from a friend of my older brother who once studied here. I chose my specialty on the advice of my elders, which in fact I did not have to regret. Overall, I like the band I got into. That's actually all I can and want to fit into this little essay.
